## Business Intelligence

- **Methodology:** Gained proficiency in the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, leveraging tools such as Weka and RapidMiner.
- **Supervised Learning:** Practiced supervised learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees for tasks such as classification and regression.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Applied unsupervised learning algorithms like K-Means clustering to uncover patterns and groupings within datasets.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Utilized outlier detection algorithms such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to identify anomalies and unusual data points in large datasets.
- **Regression Analysis:** Implemented linear regression techniques to model relationships between variables and predict outcomes based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization:** Created visualizations using tools like Power BI and Tableau to present data insights.


## Database

[**The Spotify Streaming Data Management System**](https://github.com/RyanRen2023/Portfolio/tree/main/05Database/The Spotify Streaming Data Management System) is a robust application designed to manage and interact with extensive music streaming data. Utilizing Microsoft SQL Server for the database backend and Microsoft Access for the frontend, this system efficiently handles user data, playlists, albums, and subscription information.

##Java(OOP + Design Patterns)
[**Library Management System**](https://github.com/RyanRen2023/s3ooplabs/tree/Assignment02) was developed as part of the CST8288 course at Algonquin College. The system manages various library events such as workshops, book launches, kids' stories, and movie nights. The project demonstrates the use of design patterns, logging, and database operations.

### Labs
- [Lab 1](https://github.com/RyanRen2023/s3ooplabs/tree/Lab01): This project is an implementation of a Vehicle Management System using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It includes various types of vehicles and provides functionality to build, manage, and display these vehicles. The project demonstrates the use of design patterns such as Builder and Singleton.
- [Lab 2](https://github.com/RyanRen2023/s3ooplabs/tree/Lab02): DAO Design Patterns
    - Objective:
      - Demonstrate the Data Access Object (DAO) Design Pattern.
      - Use the DAO pattern to consume a CSV file and update your database.
      - Understand the importance of good input validation.

##Mobile(Dart + Flutter + SQlite)

### Week 3 Lab

Creating a second page for your app:
Add a second page to your app called ProfilePage. Then when you use your login page, and your password is correct, navigate to your new page.

### Week 6 Lab
[Week 6 Lab Repository](https://github.com/RyanRen2023/s3mobile/tree/Week6-Lab)

ListViews:
Create a "To Do" list application that lets users add items to a list. The user can type into a TextField and click "Add" which should then make the item in the List.

### Week 8 Lab
[Week 8 Lab Repository](https://github.com/RyanRen2023/s3mobile/tree/Week8-Lab)

Using Database with Flutter:
This project demonstrates the use of a SQLite database in a Flutter application using the Floor package. The application allows users to manage a list of Todo items with the ability to add, view, and delete items. The data is securely stored using encrypted shared preferences.

### Week 9 Lab
[Week 9 Lab Repository](https://github.com/RyanRen2023/s3mobile/tree/Week9-Lab)

Responsive Layouts:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a responsive layout in a Flutter application. The application adapts to different screen sizes to provide an optimal user experience on various devices. The Todo list application from the previous weeks is enhanced with a responsive layout that adjusts the display of the todo list and the detailed view of selected items based on the screen size.
